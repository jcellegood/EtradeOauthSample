EtradeOauthSample
=================

A complete C# sample app that connects to the ETrade API via Oauth

Uses: https://github.com/jejernig/DevDefined.OAuth---Etrade

This is a simple C# console app with the BaseOauthRepository class written by jejernig.  I added a class that exposes a few of the Etrade rest calls to get you started.  

I know a lot of people have been looking for a simple example for this.  jejernig helped me, so I hope it helps others.

The project is in ZIP format in the downloads area.  (I'm still learning gothub)
